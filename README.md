# glmnetUtils

## Note for version 1.1.2

This version fixes a bug in the assignment of observations to crossvalidation folds in `cva.glmnet`. The impact is most serious for small datasets, where the number of observations per fold is relatively low. If you are using this function, it's highly recommended you update the package.

Some quality-of-life functions to streamline the process of fitting elastic net models with `glmnet`, specifically:

* `glmnet.formula` provides a formula/data frame interface to `glmnet`.
* `cv.glmnet.formula` does a similar thing for `cv.glmnet`.
* Methods for `predict` and `coef` for both the above.
* A function `cva.glmnet` to choose both the alpha and lambda parameters via cross-validation, following the approach described in the help page for `cv.glmnet`. Optionally does the cross-validation in parallel.
* Methods for `plot`, `predict` and `coef` for the above.

You can install the development version from Github using `devtools::install_github`.
